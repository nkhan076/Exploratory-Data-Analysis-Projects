#### Data description #### 
The attached file `historical_data.csv` contains a subset of deliveries received at DoorDash in early 2015 in a subset of the cities. Each row in this file corresponds to one unique delivery. Each column corresponds to a feature as explained below. Note all money (dollar) values given in the data are in cents and all time duration values given are in seconds 
The target value to predict here is the total seconds value between `created_at` and `actual_delivery_time`. 

We have added noise to the dataset to obfuscate certain business details. Both `historical_data.csv` and `predict_data.csv` include similar noise. We will only be evaluating your model's performance on this noisy, artificial dataset. The baseline model we will compare it was also trained and evaluated on the same noisy dataset.

#### Columns in historical_data.csv

### Time features
market_id: A city/region in which DoorDash operates, e.g., Los Angeles, given in the data as an id
created_at: Timestamp in UTC when the order was submitted by the consumer to DoorDash. (Note this timestamp is in UTC, but in case you need it, the actual timezone of the region was US/Pacific)
actual_delivery_time: Timestamp in UTC when the order was delivered to the consumer

### Store features 
store_id: an id representing the restaurant the order was submitted for

### Order features
subtotal: total value of the order submitted (in cents)

### Market features
DoorDash being a marketplace, we have information on the state of marketplace when the order is placed, that can be used to estimate delivery time. The following features are values at the time of `created_at` (order submission time)
total_onshift_dashers: Number of available dashers who are within 10 miles of the store at the time of order creation 
total_busy_dashers: Subset of above `total_onshift_dashers` who are currently working on an order
total_outstanding_orders: Number of orders within 10 miles of this order that are currently being processed.

### Predictions from other models:
We have predictions from other models for various stages of delivery process that we can use.
estimated_store_to_consumer_driving_duration: Estimated travel time between store and consumer (in seconds)

#### Data to predict #### 
Also attached here is `predict_data.csv`, which provides the new data that you must predict on using the model you build. This data was generated similar to the `historical_data.csv` and it contains the same columns as above, except for the following differences:
  * This file does not contain `actual_delivery_time`, since that is unknown at the time of prediction
  * This file contains `delivery_id` as additional field
Each row of the data is one data point to predict on. Note that `predict_data.csv` contains orders from later weeks compared to `historical_data`
